# Cricket-League-Service
This is a learning project to create a RESTful web service with the help of Spring framework, my primary intention is to learn Spring with Hibernate. I've taken a different approach to develop this application, unlike traditional way, I'm developing the middle layer first with Spring Boot and Beans and then once a complete Use Case is written I'd add the database layer with Hibernate. A pseudo database manager is created for this purpose to act as one when no database is configured, which add the flexibility to test the middle layer APIs as I add them. With the help of JUnit and Mockito test cases are created along with APIs. However not all cases are covered, only the key cases are tested, leaving the corner cases to be defined when I'd actually connect both layers (API and database).

Reason for choosing Spring Boot is to get a jump start although to learn Spring I’d prefer do it from scratch if there is enough time to work on. Hopefully I’d learn more as I go deep in it. The next phase I’ve planned once the web service is written is to write a mobile application to connect with it and aiming to release this project as a mobile app for general use for free.
